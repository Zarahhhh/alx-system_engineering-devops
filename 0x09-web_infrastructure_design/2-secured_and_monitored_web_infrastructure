Explanation:
- **Firewalls:** Protect against unauthorized access.
- **HTTPS:** Encrypts data between client and server.
- **Monitoring:** Tracks server performance and detects issues.

Issues:
- SSL termination at the load balancer level can be insecure.
- Single writable MySQL node can limit performance.
- Overloaded servers due to lack of resource specialization.
