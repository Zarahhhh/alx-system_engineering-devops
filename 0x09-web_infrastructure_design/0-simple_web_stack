Explanation:
- **Server:** A computer hosting all components.
- **Domain Name:** `foobar.com` points to the server via an A record.
- **Web Server (Nginx):** Serves static content and routes requests to the application server.
- **Application Server:** Runs the application logic.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores and manages data.

Issues:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server goes down, the site is unavailable.
- Maintenance Downtime: Updates require the server to restart.
- Scalability: Cannot handle heavy traffic.
