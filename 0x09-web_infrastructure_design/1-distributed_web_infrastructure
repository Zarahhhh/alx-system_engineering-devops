Explanation:
- **Servers:** Two servers for redundancy.
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy):** Distributes traffic using a round-robin algorithm.
- **Database:** Primary node handles writes; replica handles reads.

Issues:
- SPOF: Load balancer can fail.
- Security: No HTTPS or firewalls.
- Monitoring: No performance tracking.
