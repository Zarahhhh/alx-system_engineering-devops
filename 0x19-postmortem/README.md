🚨 The Case of the Disappearing Homepage

Issue Summary

📅 Date: March 5, 2025

⏰ Duration: 10:00 AM - 10:15 AM WAT

📉 Impact: 80% of users saw a "404 Not Found" error 😭

🎯 Root Cause: Someone accidentally deleted index.html (oops!).

At exactly 10:00 AM WAT, our website decided to vanish into the digital abyss, leaving users staring at a 404 Not Found page. It was like our homepage went on an unannounced vacation—without an out-of-office message.

After some panic debugging (and checking if we forgot to pay for the domain—nope, still ours!), we realized the culprit:

🚨 The index.html file was missing. Gone. Poof. Vanished.

🔍 Timeline: How It Unfolded

•	10:00 AM WAT – A user reported: "Hey, where did the homepage go?" 🤔

•	10:05 AM WAT – Engineers checked the server logs… nothing suspicious.

•	10:10 AM WAT – Discovery: index.html was missing! 🔍

•	10:12 AM WAT – File restored from backup (phew!).

•	10:15 AM WAT – Website back online! 🎉

💥 Root Cause & Fix

What Happened?

Someone (name withheld for their safety 😅) accidentally deleted index.html, the key file that loads our homepage.

How We Fixed It?

✔ Step 1: Restored index.html from the most recent backup.

✔ Step 2: Checked file permissions to prevent unauthorized deletion.

✔ Step 3: Verified the homepage was working again.

🛡️ Prevention: Never Again!

To ensure our homepage doesn’t "ghost" us again, we’ve implemented:

✅ Lock Critical Files – No more accidental deletions!

✅ Daily Backups – Because disasters love surprises.

✅ Automated Alerts – Immediate notifications when key files are missing.

✅ Employee Training – "How Not to Accidentally Delete The Internet 101."
